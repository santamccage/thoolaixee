I want to know what I should look out for and what order I should upgrade.

For instance, in Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 8, my old Mobility Radeon x300 and Geforce GO 6800 (with nvidia-legacy or whatever it's called), and Intel HD Graphics 3000 work great. In Ubuntu 17 and Debian 9, as well as a few other newer distro versions (such as the latest Mint), the drivers simply don't work at all, thus a noticeable performance hit. Help is much appreciated.

It’s a website that will help many students (Can’t share many details till it is complete and functional). Would like a sub where I can share projects that will impact lives.

Every Friday we need to submit our timesheets in PWA for approval. Every week I just BS random numbers that make sense and submit it. Nobody ever seems to double check or care what I put in there, they just get real pushy and go into panic mode if PWA is not complete on Monday morning. I feel this is a waste of time. Has anyone ever worked the other end of it where you actually review Free After Effects templates. Download after effects templates, videohive templates, Video Effects Hey r/design_critques, I am looking for feedback on any aspect of my side project website: www.stealengine.com Thanks, netfl0. 
Уважаемые коллеги, Организационный комитет рад пригласить Вас принять участие в 5-ой Международной конференции «Цифровые технологии в науке и индустрии – 2019» (dtsi-2019), посвященной 10-летию. We have had a PWA for a long time. Users want to see what BI reporting is available. I create a new subside off of PWA using the "Business Intellegence Center" template. Now what? I have empty libraries for "Dashboards," "Data Connections," and "Performance Point Content" and a "Documents" Library with just "Excel Serivces Sample Workbook". The users are mainly interested in what kinds of options we have to visualize project and task data. I seem to recall in SP 2010 we had a library of "Data. Статьи В этом разделе размещаются статьи, написанные для нашего форума, а также тематические статьи с других форумов и порталов. Our Project Web App has a "Sample Reports" library. We have gone through a few different domain name changes in the company since installing SP 2013, and now all of the sample report excel files have outdated connections. The excel files refuse to save new connections, and throw errors even when they do. Is there way to generate a "fresh" Sample Reports library where the excel files loaded have the new pwa odc connections already После выполнения этой команды в папке проекта должна появиться подпапка node_modules, которая содержит все используемые зависимости и пакеты.

Good afternoon everyone! I don't normally follow this sub, as I'm not an O365 Admin - and I usually just use Email/Excel/Word/PowerBI - but hopefully you'll be kind and help out a newbie. I have recently been made a site admin for our Project Web App Site - so I can set up Timesheets, and do some PowerBI reporting on them. I am semi-familiar with Project as a software, but I'm not a Sharepoint developer. I have a temporary Project Online Professional License to use while Название: Web-сервисы Microsoft. NET Автор: Игорь Шапошников Издательство: БХВ-Петербург Год:. Hello all! I'm a homegrown Sharepoint 'admin' (they gave me the keys and said "go") and have been working to develop a flexible Project Management environment utilizing our Sharepoint and the Project Web App. I've gotten down the base of what we would be using but now i am trying to fine tune communications and status reporting. I know that Project Server had the ability to ping users/teams assigned to tasks for Status Updates, but for the life of me i can't find any documentation out there. 
Сегодня мы рассмотрим wi-fi модуль NodeMcu v3 с чипом ESP8266 (ESP-12e) и работу с ним в среде разработки Arduino IDE 1.6.5. I made a call for participants three weeks ago in this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/4v27iv/participants_needed_for_my_computer_science/) - thank you all of those who have taken part so far! After this weekend (provisionally on midday Monday, GMT), I will be shutting down the server and finalising the statistics. I have found that dozens of participants started the first half of the study but didn't submit their assessment scores amp feedback for the second We have SP2010 and PWA 2010. Right now all staffs (resources) timesheet will be auto populated during weekend. But I am not sure how to verify the exact date and time it happened and how to change it. Could you please advice. so in project web app for sharpoint. one person is putting up projects but wants to change the owner from them to the person who will use it most. I cant figure out where to go to change the owner of a project. any help would be great. We have two SP2010 farm with PWA service application installed. One is UAT farm and one is PROD farm. I want to copy everything from UAT to PROD (it is not yet release to users). May I know what is the proper procedure? I read this article: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd207296(v=office.14).aspx and getting lose in 2nd paragraph already. Storing site content in a separate database Storing the content in a separate database involves attaching a content database 
I have a PWA 2013 farm with a PDP of type (2) New Project based on the ProjectDetails PDP. This is the new project page I have configured for my Enterprise Project Type. After the project is created, if I try to go back and edit the description field of the PDP it allows me to modify the text, save, and check in. The message box even says save successful. But then when I go back to look at the page the field is not updated. It appears that this is by design for the type (2) PDP's, but I can't. Trying to get Project Server 2013 up and going in a development/semi-production environment. I have everything installed and have a Project Web App instance running (at but whenever I try and navigate there I get an Access denied error, where I can submit a request to get to the site. I can get to the Settings page for the site collection but when I try and get to the home page for the site or any of the Project pages underneath it I get that Access Denied. We recently installed Project Server 2013 on our SP 2013 farm and I've been going through the configuration process. The web app itself seems to be running fairly smooth, but when I try to connect Project Professional to the Project Web App I get a connection error, "Project was unable to establish a connection with.". It looked like I needed to set the Project Server Permissions mode to ProjectServer in order to allow users to log on with project professional. After doing Hi, I am new to using modules with IntelliJ. I am working on a JavaFX project, web app and mobile app. The web and mobile app are not related to JavaFX and are separate from the IntelliJ project, I just wanted to mention them for context. The desktop JavaFX application will follow MVC principles. My question is how can I take advantage of the module feature of IntelliJ for this kind of project. From my understanding, I should build a module for the desktop UI that would contain TLDR: Crap internship vs. side projects? Which should I choose? I am a sophmore cs major at a top 20 state school, and internship applications for this summer have been total crap. I started the process way too late (late jan.), I applied to about 15 companies, some through referrals, some through my schools career fair, some on glassdoor. Now it's looking like I will only have one offer: The company is a fairly large local retail business with a national presence and about 200 stores. Tell /r/python what you're working on this week! You can be bragging, grousing, sharing your passion, or explaining your pain. Talk about your current project or your pet project; whatever you want to share. I'm pretty new to devops, and I'm not looking for a job or anything. As a developer I'd love to see more case studies and deployment technology stacks. Generally we prototype with Heroku and then use Gitlab to deploy to production servers (DO, OVH, occasionally aws). As a newcomer to Devops concepts, I'd love to hear more about specific workflows, add to my reading. I have to build a mid-complexity Android+iOS app. I'm coming from native Android. But this is not important, I would like to know your reason. Spring Framework was initially designed in the 2000s as an alternative to Java EE, which was too heavy and complicated. However, Java EE has improved much since then. Developing an EJB, web app or web service today is not as bad as 15 years ago. They are mostly POJO classes with annotations, EL, JSTL and JSF have made JSP better, and the IDE/ant/maven/gradle today are doing the necessary WAR/EAR packaging well. Today I pick up a book to learn Spring Framework, and waded painfully through Sprin. 
Hey folks! I’ll preface this with - I’m a full stack dev here that’s done a couple of React, React Native, Vue and Angular projects over the past few years, and now working on a React/TS/GraphQL app. First half of my career is mostly Rails, Laravel, Django. I just wanted to get opinions on those of you using any of the current hotness front-end frameworks, and what you love / hate about them, as I’m not currently enjoying the current way of working. These state/component view libraries. </p>

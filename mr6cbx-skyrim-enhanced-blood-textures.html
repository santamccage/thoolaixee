If for any reason you can't find the crafting manual download Add. Item. Menu and add any items you like manually. my 1st post on this subreddit Hey guys, after a year of not playing Skyrim I decided to install the game again and ive been re-downloading all of my old mods that I had, one of my favourite mods was 'enhanced blood textures' For some reason whenever the main menu loads up the game crashes back to my desktop! I dont know why it does this because I used to play with this mod last year. Any help would be appreciated :) https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60/ - The Mod edit: spelling. Скачать игры » Игры для PC » RPG » The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Legendary Edition MegaMod's Edition Pack (2011) (RePack oт Аронд). (Sorry this post is so long) Okay, so I've been playing this game with mods for quite some time now, so I'm used to crashes and fixing them. Last night though, I watched my sister play, and we installed a few mods to try on a new save : Cats of Skyrim. Winterhold Rebuilt, Undead FX and MOSost (which adds music from other series installments). We both didn't really like them, so we deleted them all except MOSost, but we didn't think it would be an issue as we used a new save. Today however Skyrim: SLMP-GR (Simple Lore Mods Pack - Game Ready) скачать торрентом - встречайте логическое продолжение развития SLMP-JG проекта SLMP! Проект кардинального, глубокого и лорного улучшения. I've made a few other posts about this and unfortunately none of the answers really helped, so I'm at it again. I'm playing SSE on Xbox one and want to run a modded play through. The issue is every time I try to go into dragonreach to start the dragons quest line, the game crashes. It goes into the loading menu for a little bit and then i get kicked straight back to the home screen of my box. I'd love some help reordering my load order so that my game will run correctly. I'd be willing to venmo. I recently got into playing Skyrim again and threw some mods onto my game to make it a bit different/better. The issue I’m having is; every time I go into dragonsreach for the first time to start the dragon quest, my game crashes and I get kicked back to the home screen of my Xbox. I’m going to post my load order and any help would be much appreciated UESSE Falskaar The forgotten city The Paarthurnax dilemma Far better sun Surreal lighting Enhanced night Breezehome JK’s Skyrim- 
Title says pretty much all of it. I have an AMD RX 480 8gb, and an Intel 17-7700 @ 3.60 GHz, and 16gb of ddr4 ram. I have a lot more mods running, and I will try to list most of the mods on my load order (on vacation so I don’t have a computer). Load order: Noble Skyrim full pack Enhanced texture detail Skyland Climates of Tamriel High poly project Rustic clothing Wet and cold RLO Book covers of Skyrim Enhanced blood textures Inigo Immersive citizens Realistic water two Enhanced fire medium. I’ve played Skyrim for a bit more than 2 years now. Problem is I played it on PS4. Anyways, I’m getting pc soon, and after many research and editing, I believe I have come up with the ultimate modlist that improves almost every single aspect of Skyrim. But, it can still improve, which is why it’s here, i know it’s long and lots of you will not even bother trying to help after seeing its size but, for those that do, I’m forever grateful. I am open to all kinds of feedback, tips, donts Whenever I get close to the second wayshrine in Forgotten Vale, my game just closes. I've tried restarting my computer, I've tried googling it with no luck. ​ Specs: ​ CPU - Intel i-5 GPU - AMD Radeon rx 560 Hard drive 8GB Ram ​ Modlist ​ achievements mods enabler Bandolier better dialogue controls better serana birds of skyrim campfire candle glow cutting room floor Darker nights diverse skyrim dragonbone ebonsteel armor ducks and swans for skyrim enhanced blood textures. So I have my Skyrim: -Supersampling set a bit higher than normal -TAA off -Settings on Medium -Immersive Citizens -Immersive Patrols -JK’s Skyrim -Enhanced Blood Textures -Realistic Lighting Overhaul -Vivid Weathers -Realistic Water 2 -WICO -Skyrim 2017 Textures -Floral Overhaul -Realistic Road Signs 4K I run this all with 16 Gigs of RAM, an I5 6k Series (Or 5k or 7k. Don’t remember), and a GTX 1070 Ti. (I have other mods, but those I doubt would affect performance much) My question Edit: I'm not using a custom race, just the default races like Breton, Bosmer, Imperial ect. First, Modwatch's server isn't responding today, so Ill copy and past my list from the modorganizer folder. I tried to turn one of my characters into a vampire today, via a Sacrosanct Potion of Embracing. I got the message that my "blood boils in the sunlight" like normal, but no Vampire abilities were added(neither Sacrosanct powers or even the Vampiric Drain spell from Vanilla). So I progressed. The LOD of Bruma's city walls are flickering for me, I uninstalled A Quality World Map, have disabled Vivid Weathers, updated my Nvidia Drivers, used the Nvidia fixes suggested on numerous threads and still cannot get the flickering to stop, any suggestions? I haven't got a particularly large modlist atm as I only just started putting it together, it consists of the following Unofficial Elder Scrolls Patch Alternate Start Live Another Life Static Mesh Improvement Mod SkyUI Total Character.

EDIT: I left out a mod Title says it all: I'm looking for some fun Lore-Friendly and Realistic mods. That includes things to help with the immersion. When I play Skyrim(or any Bethesda game), I like to be fully immersed in a living, breathing world. And mods help me do just that! So I'm wondering which mods you guys use, whether they be behavioral, or that they modify an existing faction or creature, or they are weapons or armor. Mostly I would like some weapon and armor recommendations thoug. Firstly, when all working as intended, this is by far the most immersive, exciting and interesting world I've been in yet. The mods I will point to below make a world of difference. It's more than worth it to go through the large setup. I've got 75fps butter everywhere except towns, where it's 65-75 - R9 280x here. Torrent with everything now available at bottom of post! ATTENTION NVIDIA GPUS - If you are experiencing inexplicably low frame rates, update your cards drivers Ok so lets get some of your first questions out of the way. Console - Xbox One Skyrim Special Edition - Most updated version When did this start happening? As soon as I started using mods. I stopped playing Skyrim a while ago because I sunk about 15 hours into play mods before I went to do an actual game save. I was fine with the constant auto saves up until then. When I went to do the game save it wouldn't save. I disabled all mods and re-enabled, re ordered, nothing seemed to work.Since. First and foremost, for anyone looking for a solid load-order to build on, I recommend youtuber Akatsuki's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKdyj8lIivoampt=647s (A typed list is available in the comments, user: FIR3 MAUI WAUI) I tweaked a few things, namely the "realism" mods toward the end. 100 carry limit with 1 lb a stamina level, my ass. Used other, adjustable, ones instead. This is the most recent in his series, and what I used to build what has been a suprisingly stable (If not always. 
Did I get my get my load order right because there are still crashes from time to time im a beginner in modding on xbox 1 in Skyrim i looked up a lot of guides but i still can't get the hang of it. So here's the list in order the way i put it: Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Campfire: Complete Campfire system vivid weathers special edition lush overhaul landscape fixes for grass mods enhanced night skyrim enhanced blood textures the notice board lanterns of skyrim bridges of skyrim rs children. So I got SSE for my xbox and decided to download a bunch of mods, although I'm a clueless idiot and don't know what the load order is, or whats the best load order for my mods, can anyone recommend to me the best order so my game doesn't constantly crash and they don't conflict with each other?
